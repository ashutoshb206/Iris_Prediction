# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning


This project showcases a simple yet effective implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. It is built using Python and leverages popular ML libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains 150 samples with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of three species.
