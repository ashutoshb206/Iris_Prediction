# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning


This project showcases a simple yet effective implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. It is built using Python and leverages popular ML libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains 150 samples with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of three species.

## ü§ñ Algorithms Implemented

The following supervised machine learning algorithms are used for classification:

- ‚úÖ Decision Tree Classifier
- ‚úÖ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ‚úÖ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- ‚úÖ Logistic Regression

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

We use the following performance metrics to evaluate the models:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## RESULTS

| Algorithm              | Accuracy |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| Decision Tree          | \~95%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | \~96%    |
| Support Vector Machine | \~97%    |
| Logistic Regression    | \~94%    |
Note: These results may vary slightly based on train-test split.
